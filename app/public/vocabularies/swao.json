			"comment": "NestedPIDSelector describes a hierarchically ordered list of resource identifiers, to be used in an annotation target. The hierachy consist of part-whole relationships or other hierarchal  relationships. The resource identifiers should be ordered top down, with the largest/encompassing resource first, and the smallest/deepest nested resource last. The purpose of the NestedPIDSelector is to allow annotations to be retrieved by target identifiers at different levels. For instance, an annotation on a page from a manuscript may target a specific textregion of that page. The textregion might have its own identifier, but the page and the manuscript also have identifiers. By adding all three identifiers in a NestedPIDSelector, the annotation can be retrieved for all three levels.",
