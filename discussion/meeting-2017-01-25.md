# Project - Editie Als Werkinstrument
Meeting: 2017-01-24

Demo:

+ IgnoreableElement, SelectWholeElement
+ ownership, edit, delete
+ annotations on annotations
+ Delpher version with own ontology

Issues:

+ grouping annotations, default context tag
+ hierarchical resource relation annotation
+ show resource hierarchy and how they correspond to the DOM
+ additional motivations/tasks, loadable from config
+ option to build user-specific codebooks
+ bottom-up coding

Questions:

+ In the [generic ontology](http://boot.huygens.knaw.nl/annotate/genericontology.ttl), the `hi:hasAnnotation` property has label `hasSuggestedAnnotationType`. Where do suggested annotation types come from? 

+ Are elements with an `about` attribute the containers of annotatable things?

+ How can the annotation client communicate to the user what the structure of annotatable things is?

+ Should the annotation client show markers in the display to indicate regions with annotations (e.g. beginning and end markers of annotation targets)?

+ Should the annotation include a URL of the location where the annotation was made (contextual information)?
